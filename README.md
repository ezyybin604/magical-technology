# Magical Technology

[The modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/magical-technology)

## A modpack mostly about aesthetics technology (Create and Botania) & exploration & also combat

### Maybe bring a friend along the way :)

# *

When progressing through this experience, the progression will skip to doing combat, tech progression of different mods, bossfights, upgrading your armor, and building a nice base. Because of course, no tech mods with magic boxes here!

The entire thing is what came out of the thought of "**what if i put exploration and tech modpacks in a blender**"

And also more sanboxy stuff too why not

Basically two **polar oppisites** of modpack audiances

Some important mods are:
- The Twilight Forest (not included, you will have to download it manually)
- Create
- Botania
- A mod made for the modpack to tie all the loose ends
